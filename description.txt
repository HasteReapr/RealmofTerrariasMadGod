Realm of the Terrarian's Mad God is a mod based off the popular MMO RPG game, Realm of the Mad God. It adds many new items, like swords and ablities and NPCs. 
Most sprites made by Vale.

1.7 is a decently big content update! It brings every class ability and armors!
Also added a UI feature that is toggled by typing /stats into chat. It displays your current stats and the max stats. (Which I may make randomized later on...)
Will start development on dungeons soon(TM).

Special thanks to people in the TModLoader discord being super patient with my dumb questions and helping me understand everything instead of being rude.
Especially Dr.Serous, DireWolf, and JopoJelly for patientely helping me.
